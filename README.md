# Jetpack Joyride Clone

This project is a clone of the classic **Jetpack Joyride** game, created as part of the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/jetpack/). You can play the game here: `url to come`.

## Implementation Goals

- [x] Create a game world with a floor. The world will scroll from right to left endlessly.
- [x] Add a player character that falls when no input is held, but rises when the input is held.
- [] Add obstacles that move from right to left. Feel free to make more than one type of obstacle.
  - [] Obstacles can be placed in the world using a script so the level can be truly endless.
  - [] Obstacles should either be deleted or recycled when they leave the screen.
- [] The score increases with distance. The goal is to beat your previous score, so the high score should be displayed alongside the current score.

### Stretch Goals

- [] The jetpack is a machine gun! Add bullet objects that spew from your character when the input is held.
  - [] Particle effects are a fun way to add game juice. Mess around with some here, making explosions or sparks when things get destroyed!

### Super Stretch Goals

- [] Compose and integrate background music to enhance the experience.
